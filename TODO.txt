TODO:
PRIORITY:
- Make a display for particle count.


GENERAL:
- Make it that interaction radius can only reach a maximum of 90% of half the smallest screen dimension.
- Make it that interaction doesn't get stuck on the walls when the cursor leaves the canvas.


PERFORMANCE:
-


CODE REFACTORING:
- Move colour maps to a different place.


BUGS:
- When you turn off all particle separating forces, and force all particles into the exact same position (so all particles are exactly overlapping), then the simulation cannot recover (since overlaps aren't resolved for completely overlapping particles).
- Stiffness 0 projection 0 separation 1 causes extreme lag.

NTH:
- Make low density colour particles fade into the speed colour slower when both are active.
