FIX:
- Rewrite createParticles() function, currently points can be placed intersecting the 
top of the screen if NUMBER_OF_PARTICLES is set too large. Also should just write the
function better.

- Check animate() function.

- Change particle = particle[i] to for..of loops.

- Refactor the code, current state is embarrassing.



COMPLETE:
- Add FLIP.

- Add a pressure grid (reduce divergence in dense regions and vice versa).

- Separate particles using spatial hashing.
