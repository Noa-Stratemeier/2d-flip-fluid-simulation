PRIORITY:
- 


GENERAL:
- Look to scale gravity in a way so users constant makes more sense (so -9.81 approximates reality).
- Add the following code after gl = canvas.getContext('webgl2'); in initialiseScene() to get crisper particles:
// Make CSS size (logical) match the simulation domain
canvas.style.width  = scene.flipFluidSimulation.width  + 'px';
canvas.style.height = scene.flipFluidSimulation.height + 'px';
// Scale the backing store for HiDPI
const dpr = Math.max(1, window.devicePixelRatio || 1);
canvas.width  = Math.round(scene.flipFluidSimulation.width  * dpr);
canvas.height = Math.round(scene.flipFluidSimulation.height * dpr);
// Keep the viewport in sync
gl.viewport(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);



PERFORMANCE:
- Check performance loss from adding getComponentData and getWeightsAndIndices functions. 
- Check performance gain from preassigning 'let x = this.x'.
- Check performance gain from precomputing terms in the weight calculations.


CODE REFACTORING:
- Maybe replace xi, yi with helper functions.
- Maybe reduce code repetition.
- Separate particles function is pretty ugly.
- Maybe put function to compute rest density in its own method.
