TODO:
PRIORITY:
- Currently touch and mouse interaction uses same cursor repel radius and strength (cursor repel radius should probably scale based on screen dimensions.)


GENERAL:
- Look to scale gravity in a way so users constant makes more sense (so -9.81 approximates reality).


PERFORMANCE:
-


CODE REFACTORING:
-


BUGS:
- Rotating the screen to landscape on mobile devices breaks simulation.
