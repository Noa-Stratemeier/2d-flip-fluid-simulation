FIX:
- Rewrite createParticles() function, currently points can be placed intersecting the 
top of the screen if NUMBER_OF_PARTICLES is set too large. Also should just write the
function better.

- Check animate() function.

- Fix transfer velocities to particles code.

- Refactor the code, current state is embarrassing.

- Fix drawing logic. Use transform feedback.

- Improve FLIP Code.



COMPLETE:
- Separate particles using spatial hashing.

- Add a pressure grid (reduce divergence in dense regions and vice versa).
