TODO:
PRIORITY:
- Make a display for particle count.


GENERAL:
- Make it that interaction radius can only reach a maximum of 90% of half the smallest screen dimension.
- Make it that interaction doesn't get stuck on the walls when the cursor leaves the canvas.


PERFORMANCE:
-


CODE REFACTORING:
-


BUGS:
- Rotating the screen to landscape on mobile devices breaks simulation (I think this happens when the Y-cells (resolution) makes the cell width smaller than or equal to 1 pixel).
- Particle scale slider sometimes gets stuck with cursor as red circle with diagonal cross through it.
