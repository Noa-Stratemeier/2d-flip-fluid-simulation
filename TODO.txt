TODO:
PRIORITY:
- Improve render code.


GENERAL:
- Maybe look at implementing Runge-Kutta integration for integrateParticles function.
- Rewrite createParticles() function, currently points can be placed intersecting the 
top of the screen if the particle count is set too large. Also should just write the
function better.
- Look to scale gravity in a way so users constant makes more sense (so -9.81 approximates reality).


PERFORMANCE:
- Check performance loss from adding getComponentData and getWeightsAndIndices functions. 
- Check performance gain from preassigning 'let x = this.x'.
- Check performance gain from precomputing terms in the weight calculations.


CODE REFACTORING:
- Maybe replace xi, yi with helper functions.
- Maybe reduce code repetition.
- Separate particles function is pretty ugly.
- Maybe put markCellTypes out of transferVelocitiesToGrid function.
- Maybe put function to compute rest density in its own method.


BUGS:
- setting resolution to 90 causes bug in particle spawns.
