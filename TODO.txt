TODO:
PRIORITY:
- Have particles be coloured based on speed.


GENERAL:
- Look to scale gravity in a way so users constant makes more sense (so -9.81 approximates reality).


PERFORMANCE:
- Check performance loss from adding getComponentData and getWeightsAndIndices functions. 
- Check performance gain from preassigning 'let x = this.x'.
- Check performance gain from precomputing terms in the weight calculations.


CODE REFACTORING:
- Maybe replace xi, yi with helper functions.
- Maybe reduce code repetition.
- Separate particles function is pretty ugly.
- Maybe put function to compute rest density in its own method.


BUGS:
-
