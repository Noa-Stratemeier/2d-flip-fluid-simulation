FIX:
- Rewrite createParticles() function, currently points can be placed intersecting the 
top of the screen if NUMBER_OF_PARTICLES is set too large. Also should just write the
function better.

- Check animate() function.

- Fix transfer velocities to particles code.

- Refactor the code, current state is embarrassing.

- Fix drawing logic. Use transform feedback.

- Improve FLIP Code.

- array.fill(0) = array.fill(0, 0).

- check 'for (const [index, element] of foobar.entries())', maybe storing particle velocities and positions directly in separate arrays is better.



COMPLETE:
- Separate particles using spatial hashing.

- Add a pressure grid to compensate for drift (reduce divergence in dense regions and vice versa).
